## 🚀 New Features Implemented

### 1. Repository Pattern (`lib/repositories/entry_repository.dart`)
```dart
- Decouples data access from business logic
- 5-minute caching layer for better performance
- Force refresh option for pull-to-refresh
- Automatic cache invalidation on data changes
- Centralized data access point
```

### 2. State Management with Provider (`lib/providers/entry_provider.dart`)
```dart
- ChangeNotifier-based state management
- Debounced search (300ms)
- Pagination support (20 items per page)
- Undo buffer for delete operations
- Favorites and category filtering
- Loading states (isLoading, isLoadingMore)
```

### 3. Improved Home Screen (`lib/screens/home_screen_improved.dart`)
```dart
✅ Search debouncing (300ms delay)
✅ Pagination with infinite scroll (loads more at 80% scroll)
✅ Pull-to-refresh
✅ Undo delete with SnackBar action (5-second window)
✅ Category filter UI with modal bottom sheet
✅ Category filter badge in AppBar
✅ Progress dialog for exports
✅ Better empty states (contextual messages)
✅ Scroll controller for pagination
```

### 4. Updated Screens with Repository Pattern
```dart
✅ Categories Screen - Added RefreshIndicator, uses EntryRepository
✅ Settings Screen - Uses EntryRepository for all operations
✅ All screens now use consistent error handling
```

- **After:** Debounced search with 300ms delay + database query optimization

### Memory Usage
- **Before:** All entries kept in memory
- **After:** Paginated loading + caching with automatic cleanup

### User Experience
- **Before:** No feedback during long operations
- **After:** Progress indicators, pull-to-refresh, undo functionality
